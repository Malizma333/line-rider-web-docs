2) The categories `Description` and `Examples` MUST start with verbs written in past tense.

3) The category `Parameters` MUST have each parameter description start with a noun and appropriate article.

4) Documentation as it relates to verb usage SHOULD avoid usage of generic verbs such as the past tense verbs "Sets" and "Changes".

5) All phrases and sentences MUST end in a period (.).

6) Ordinal representations of numbers SHOULD be avoided, such as "first" and "third".
