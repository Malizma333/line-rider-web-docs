### Actions

The `Actions` category contains documentation for functions that alter the global state. Each page is broken up into three sections, `Description`, `Examples`, and `Related`.

The `Description` section details the effects of the function. It also outlines syntax for the function and relevant parameters, if any.

The `Examples` section is used to demonstrate how the function is used by providing one or more snippets of code.

The `Related` section links to action functions that affect similar states.
