### Selectors

The `Selectors` category contains documentation for functions that read from the global state. Each page is broken up into three sections, `Description`, `Examples`, and `Related`.

The `Description` section details what type and value the state path returns. It also outlines syntax for the function and relevant parameters, if any.

The `Examples` section is used to demonstrate how the function is used by providing one or more snippets of code.

The `Related` section links to selector functions that affect similar states.
