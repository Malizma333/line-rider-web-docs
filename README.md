# LR Userscript Utilities

The purpose of this library is to streamline the linerider.com modmaking process by abstracting the more common functions needed in creating a working mod. The library files have been reduced to only including api functions with known functionalities that have been properly documented. There are plans to add more available functions soon once more research is done.
