# LR Userscript Utilities

### About
The purpose of this library is to streamline the linerider.com mod-making process by abstracting the more common functions needed in creating a working mod. Some capabilities are still missing, as their functionality was either unknown or unsafe in a userscript environment. There are plans to add more functions soon once more research is done.

### Current Features
- Redux Actions
- Redux Selectors
- JSDoc Type Annotations

### Planned Features
- Library-based Template Userscript
- Library Functionality Testing
- Minified Source File
- Markdown Documentation
- Common UI Component Templates
- Common Utility Algorithms

### Usage
Add `// @require https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Malizma333/lr-userscript-library/main/index.js` to the userscript's metadata.
